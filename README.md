# My Coding Comeback Journey

There was a time I walked away from coding.

I started this journey full of excitement — writing my first lines of code, dreaming of creating something impactful. But somewhere along the line, confusion crept in. The errors felt louder than the breakthroughs, and self-doubt began to weigh me down. I convinced myself that maybe coding just wasn't meant for me.

But a day came when I felt the nudge to start again — but this time, with God as my strong source of strength. I decided to keep my focus on my personal growth, taking things one step at a time without allowing any internal or external pressure to creep into this new journey. As I look unto God for a breakthrough, I'm trusting Him to lead me through every line of code, every bug, and every milestone.

After stepping back to realign, I realized the confusion wasn't a signal to quit — it was simply a sign to pause, breathe, and try again. Now, I'm picking up where I left off — with fresh eyes, a renewed mind, and a heart ready to embrace the process, one step at a time.

I'm giving myself permission to learn at my own pace, to celebrate small wins, and to believe that I can do this — not perfectly, but consistently.

If you're reading this and you've ever felt like giving up, remember: it's okay to take a break. What matters most is having the courage to start again.

Here's to new beginnings, one line of code at a time 💪🏽✨.
